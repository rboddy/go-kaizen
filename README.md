## Go Kaizen

Go Kaizen is a collection of small go modules that represent exercises that are meant to teach me go over time. Each module comes with its own README file to explain what I'm doing in that exercise, and the source code to solve my intended prompt. If this gets to a point where I feel like it will benefit others, I'll turn the whole thing into a single module and publish it. For now, this is for self improvement.
