## Hello Pointer

Alright, this one is all about pointers. I'll admit, as someone who primarily used JavaScript before this, pointers are a bit confusing to me at times. The easiest way to to figure this out is to practice. To do so, I created this tongue-in-cheek example. You expect to get a greeting with your name, but instead you get the memory address from the pointer. So instead, we dereference the pointer to get the actual value at that address.
